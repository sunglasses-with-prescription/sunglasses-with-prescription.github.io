    <h3>**Essential Pre-Purchase Checks**</h3>

    <h4>**Current Prescription and Pupillary Distance (PD) Accuracy**</h4>
    <p><strong>Current Prescription and Pupillary Distance (PD) Accuracy</strong> is paramount when purchasing <strong>designer readers men</strong>. An outdated prescription will result in uncomfortable and ineffective eyewear. Before ordering, ensure your prescription is current (within the last 12-18 months).
